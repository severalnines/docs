Alarms
-------

Alarms indicate problems that could affect or degrade the cluster as a whole. This interface provides a detailed explanation on the problem, together with the recommended action (if available) to resolve the problem. Each alarm is categorized as:

* Cluster
* Cluster recovery
* Database health
* Database performance
* Host
* Node
* Network

An alarm can be acknowledged by checking the *Ignore?* checkbox. When ignored, no notification will be sent via email. An alarm cannot be deleted or dismissed, though you can hide it from the list by clicking on *Hide Ignored Alarms* button.
