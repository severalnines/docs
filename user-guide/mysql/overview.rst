Add Node
````````

Adds a new or existing database node into the cluster. You can scale out your cluster by adding mode database nodes. The new node will automatically join and synchronize with the rest of the cluster. 

Create and add a new DB node
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

If you specify a new hostname or IP address, make sure that the node is accessible from ClusterControl node via passwordless SSH.

This is only available for Galera Cluster, MySQL Replication (adding slave) and MySQL Cluster.

* **Hostname**
	- IP address or :term:`FQDN` of the target node. If you already have the host added under *ClusterControl > Manage > Hosts*, you can just choose the host from the dropdown menu.

* **Configuration**
	- Choose a MySQL configuration template for the new node.
	
* **Install Software**
	- If you already have the database server installed on the target host but not yet configured, you can tell ClusterControl to skip the database installation part by choosing 'No'.

* **Disable Firewall**
	- Yes - Firewall will be disabled (recommended).
	- No - ClusterControl will not disabling any enabled firewall rules.

* **Disable AppArmor/SELinux**
	- Check the box to let ClusterControl disable AppArmor (Ubuntu) or SELinux (RedHat/CentOS) if enabled.

* **Include in Loadbalancer set (if exist)**
	- The node will be added into the load balancing set if you have HAProxy or MaxScale deployed with ClusterControl.
	
* **Do you want to delay the slave?**
	- Yes - Sets up a delayed slave.
	- No - Sets up a standard slave.
	
* **Delay slave with**
	- This option will appear only if you select Yes. Specify the value in seconds.

Add an existing DB node
'''''''''''''''''''''''

Use this feature if you have added a DB node manually to your cluster and want it to be detected and managed by ClusterControl. ClusterControl will then detect the new DB node as being part of the cluster and starts to manage and monitor it as with the rest of the cluster nodes. Useful if a node has been created outside of ClusterControl e.g, through Puppet, Chef or Ansible.

* **Hostname**
	- IP address or :term:`FQDN` of the target node.

* **Port**
	- MySQL port. Default is 3306.


Add Replication Slave
``````````````````````

MySQL replication slave requires at least a master with GTID enabled on the Galera nodes. However, we would recommend users to configure all Galera nodes as master for better failover. GTID is required as it is used to do master failover (MariaDB's  GTID is not supported at the moment). If you are running on MySQL 5.5, you might need to upgrade to MySQL 5.6.

The following must be true for the masters:

* At least one master among the Galera nodes.
* MySQL GTID must be enabled.
* ``log_slave_updates`` must be enabled.
* Masterâ€™s MySQL port is accessible by ClusterControl and slaves.

To configure a Galera node as master, go to *ClusterControl > Nodes > choose the mysql server > Enable Binary Logging*. In the "Enable Binary Logging" dialog, set the binary logs expiration, set "Enable GTID" to yes and "auto-restart node" to yes, then click Proceed.

Or, you can also achieve the same thing manually by appending the following lines into the corresponding ``my.cnf``. Do not forget to restart the MySQL server to load the changes:

.. code-block:: bash

	server_id=<must be unique across all mysql servers participating in replication>
	binlog_format=ROW
	log_slave_updates=1
	log_bin=binlog
	gtid_mode=ON
	enforce_gtid_consistency=1

For the slave, you would need a separate host or VM, with or without MySQL installed. If you do not have a MySQL installed, and choose ClusterControl to install the MySQL on the slave, ClusterControl will perform the necessary actions to prepare the slave, for example, configure root password (based on ``monitored_mysql_root_password``), create slave user, configure MySQL, start the server and also start the replication. The MySQL package used will be based on the Galera vendor used, for example, if you are running Percona XtraDB Cluster, ClusterControl will prepare the slave using Percona Server. Prior to the deployment, you must perform following actions:

* The slave node must be accessible using passwordless SSH from the ClusterControl server
* MySQL port (default 3306) and :term:`netcat` port 9999 on the slave are open for connections.
* You must configure the following options in the ClusterControl configuration file for the respective cluster ID under ``/etc/cmon.cnf`` or ``/etc/cmon.d/cmon_<cluster ID>.cnf``:

.. code-block:: bash

	monitored_mysql_root_password=<the mysql root password of all nodes including slave>


We have covered an example deployment in this blog post, `Deploy an asynchronous slave to Galera Cluster for MySQL - The Easy Way <http://www.severalnines.com/blog/deploy-asynchronous-slave-galera-mysql-easy-way>`_.

Add New Replication Slave
''''''''''''''''''''''''''

The slave will be setup from a streamed XtraBackup from the master to the slave. 

* **Master Server**
	- Select a master server. Only Galera nodes that generate binary log are listed here.

* **Slave Server**
	- Specify the IP address or FQDN of the slave node. This node must be accessible from ClusterControl node via passwordless SSH beforehand.

* **Netcat port**
	- Choose a port to stream Xtrabackup. Default port is 9999. This port must be reachable by the selected Master Server.

* **Do you want to delay the slave?**
	- Yes - Sets up a delayed slave.
	- No - Sets up a standard slave.
	
* **Delay slave with**
	- This option will appear only if you select Yes. Specify the value in seconds.

* **Do you want to install the Slave server**
	- Yes - Install MySQL Server packages. It will based on the repository and vendor for Galera node. For example, if you are running on Percona XtraDB Cluster, ClusterControl will setup a standalone Percona XtraDB Cluster node as the slave.

* **Disable firewall**
	- Check the box to disable firewall (recommended).

* **Disable SELinux/AppArmor**
	- Check the box to let ClusterControl disable AppArmor (Ubuntu) or SELinux (RedHat/CentOS) if enabled (recommended).

.. Note:: Existing MySQL server packages will be uninstalled.


Add Existing Replication Slave
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

Add an existing replication slave into ClusterControl. Use this feature if you have added a replication slave manually to your cluster and want it to be detected/managed by ClusterControl. ClusterControl will then detect the new database node as being part of the cluster and starts to manage and monitor it as with the rest of the cluster nodes. Useful if a node has been configured outside of ClusterControl e.g, through Puppet, Chef or Ansible.

* **Hostname**
	- Specify the slave IP address or FQDN.

* **Port**
	- MySQL port. Default is 3306. This port must be reachable by ClusterControl.


Clone Cluster
``````````````

Exclusive for Galera Cluster. This feature allows you to create, in one click, an exact copy of your Galera Cluster onto a new set of hosts. The most common use case for cloning a deployment is for setting up a staging deployment for further development and test. Cloning is a â€˜hotâ€™ procedure and does not affect the operations of the source cluster. 

A clone will be created of this cluster. The following procedure applies:

* Create a new Cluster consisting of one node.
* Stage the new Cluster with SST (it is now cloned).
* Nodes will be added to the Cloned Cluster until *Cloned Cluster Size* is reached.
* Query Monitor settings and settings for Cluster Recovery and Node Recovery options are not cloned.
* The ``my.cnf`` file may not be identical on the Cloned Cluster.

* **Cloned Cluster Name**
	- The cloned cluster name.

* **Cloned Cluster Size**
	- The number of database node of the cloned cluster.

* **Disable Firewall On Cloned Nodes?**
	- Check the box to disable firewall on cloned nodes (recommended).

* **Disable SELinux/AppArmor on Cloned Nodes?**
	- Check the box to let ClusterControl disable AppArmor (Ubuntu) or SELinux (RedHat/CentOS) on cloned nodes.

* **DB Node (1-9)**
	- The database node IP address or hostname. The enable fields is depending on the Cloned Cluster Size.
	
Cluster-Cluster Replication
````````````````````````````

Exclusive for Galera Cluster. This feature allows you to create a new cluster that will be replicating from this cluster. One primary use case is for disaster recovery by having a hot standby site/cluster which can take over when the main site/cluster has failed. Clusters can be rebuilt with an existing backup or by streaming from a master on the source cluster.

For MySQL-based clusters, ClusterControl will configure asynchronous MySQL replication from a master cluster to a slave cluster.

* **Cluster Provisioning Data**
	- Choose one method to provision the slave's cluster data:
		- *Streaming from the master*: Stream the data from a master using hot backup tools e.g, Percona Xtrabackup and MariaDB Backup.
		- *Stage cluster from backup*: Choose an existing full backup from the dropdown list. If none is listed, take full backup of one of the nodes in your cluster which have binary logging enabled.

* **Replication Master**
	- A node of the source cluster to replicate from. For MySQL, the chosen node must have binary logs enabled. To do this, go to *Nodes > pick the corresponding node > Node Actions >  Enable Binary Logging*.

Once the above options have been selected, the cluster deployment wizard will appear similar to deploying a new cluster. See :ref:`Deploy Database Cluster`.

A slave cluster will appear in the database cluster list after deployment finishes. You will notice the slave cluster entry is a bit indented in the list, with a pointed arrow coming from the source cluster, indicating the cluster-cluster replication is now active.

.. Note:: We highly recommend users to enable cluster-wide read-only on the slave cluster. Disable read-only only when promoting the slave cluster as the new master cluster.

* **Host**
	- SQL node hostname or IP address.

* **Connections**
	- The number of aggregated connections across all nodes.

* **Queries**
	- The total of queries running on the node. The total number of queries is including statements like SET, BEGIN, COMMIT, etc. These statements are frequently executed by ORMs or during creation of a connection (for instance "SET NAMES UTF8") and thus create a lot of "Queries" even though they are not any queries that read or write to the database. Therefore a sum of selects, updates, deletes and inserts will not the same as the value of "Queries".

* **Selects**
	- The number of current SELECT queries on the node.

* **Inserts**
	- The number of current INSERT queries on the node.

* **Updates**
	- The number of current UPDATE queries on the node.

* **Delete**
	- The number of current DELETE queries on the node.

* **Server Version**
	- MySQL server version.

* **Uptime**
	- MySQL service uptime.

* **Last Updated**
	- The last time ClusterControl fetch for node's status.

	- Index usage in percentage.

* **Data Memory Used**
	- Data usage in percentage.

* **LongMemoryBuffer Used**
	- LongMessageBuffer usage in percentage. This is an internal buffer used for passing messages within individual nodes and between nodes.

* **RedoBuffer Used**
