Cloud Providers
+++++++++++++++++

Manages resources and credentials for cloud providers. Note that this new feature requires two modules called *clustercontrol-cloud* and *clustercontrol-clud*. The former is a helper daemon which extends CMON capability of cloud communication, while the latter is a file manager client to upload and download files on cloud instances. Both packages are dependencies of the *clustercontrol* UI package, which will be installed automatically if do not exist. 

.. seealso:: `ClusterControl Components <../components.html>`_.

The credentials that have been set up here can be used to:

- Manage cloud resources (instances, virtual network, subnet)
- Deploy databases in the cloud
- Upload backup to cloud storage

To create a cloud profile, click on *Add Cloud Credentials* and follow the wizard accordingly. Supported cloud providers are:

- Amazon Web Service
- Google Cloud Platform
- Microsoft Azure.

Amazon Web Services Credential
``````````````````````````````

The stored AWS credential will be used by ClusterControl to list out Amazon EC2 instances, spin new instances when deploying a cluster and uploading/downloading backups to AWS S3. 

To create an access key for your AWS account root user:

1. Use your AWS account email address and password to sign in to the AWS Management Console as the AWS account root user.
2. On the IAM Dashboard page, choose your account name in the navigation bar, and then choose "My Security Credentials".
3. If you see a warning about accessing the security credentials for your AWS account, choose "Continue to Security Credentials".
4. Expand the Access keys (access key ID and secret access key) section.
5. Choose "Create New Access Key". Then choose "Download Key File" to save the access key ID and secret access key to a file on your computer. After you close the dialog box, you can't retrieve this secret access key again.

Key Management
--------------

Key Management allows you to manage a set of SSL certificates and keys that can be provisioned on your clusters. This feature allows you to create Certificate Authority (CA) and/or self-signed certificates and keys. Then, it can be easily enabled and disabled for MySQL and PostgreSQL client-server connections using SSL encryption feature. See `Enable SSL Encryption <mysql/overview.html#enable-ssl-encryption>`_ for details.

Manage
++++++

Manage existing keys and certificates generated by ClusterControl.

* **Revoke**
    - Revoke the selected certificate. This will put an end to the validity of the certificate.

* **Generate**
    - Re-generate an invalid or expired certificate. By using this, ClusterControl can generate a new key and certificate by using the same information used when it was generated for the first time.

* **Move**
    - Move the selected certificate to another location. Clicking on this will open another dialog box where you can create/delete a directory under ``/var/lib/cmon/ca``. Use this feature to organize and categorize the generated certificate per directory.


Generate
++++++++

By default, the generated keys and certificates will be created under default repository at ``/var/lib/cmon/ca``. 

* **New Folder**
    - Create a new directory under the default repository.

* **Delete Folder**
    - Delete the selected directory.

* **Refresh**
    - Refresh the list.

Self-signed Certificate Authority and Key
``````````````````````````````````````````

Generate a self-signed Certificate Authority and key. You can use this Certificate Authority (CA) to sign your client and server certificates.

* **Path**
    - Certification repository path. To change the path, click on the file browser left-side menu. Default value is ``/var/lib/cmon/ca``.

* **Certificate Authority and Key Name**
    - Enter a name without extension. For example MyCA, ca-cert

* **Description**
    - Put some description for the certificate authority.

* **Country**
    - Choose a country name from the dropdown menu.

* **State**
    - State or province name.

* **Locality**
    - City name.
    
* **Organization**
    - Organization name.

* **Organization unit**
    - Unit or department name.

* **Common name**
    - Specify server fully-qualified domain name (FQDN) or your name.
    - Common Name value used for the server and client certificates/keys must each differ from the Common Name value used for the CA certificate. Otherwise, the certificate and the key files will not work for the servers compiled using OpenSSL.

* **Email**
    - Email address.

* **Key length (bits)**
    - The key length in bits. 2048 and higher is recommended. The larger the public and private key length, the harder it is to crack.

* **Expiration Date (days)**
    - Certificate expiration in days.

* **Generate**
    - Generate certificate and key.
    
* **Reset**
    - Reset the form.

Client/Server Certificates and Key
````````````````````````````````````

Sign with an existing CA or generate a self-signed certificate. ClusterControl generates certificate and key depending on the type, server or client. The generated server's key and certificate can then be used by `Enable SSL Encryption <mysql/overview.html#enable-ssl-encryption>`_ feature.

* **Certificate Authority**
    - Select an existing CA (by clicking on any existing CA on the left-hand side menu) or leave it empty to generate a self-signed certificate.

* **Type**
    - server - Generate certificate for server usage.
    - client - Generate certificate for client usage.

* **Certificate and Key Name**
    - Enter the certificate and key name. The same name will be used by ClusterControl to generate certificate and key. For example, if you specify the name is "severalnines", ClusterControl will generate ``severalnines.key`` and ``severalnines.crt`` respectively.

* **Description**
    - Put some description for the certificate and key.

* **Country**
    - Choose a country name from the dropdown menu.

* **State**
    - State or province name.

* **Locality**
    - City name.
    
* **Organization**
    - Organization name.

* **Organization unit**
    - Unit or department name.

* **Common name**
    - Specify server fully-qualified domain name (FQDN) or your name.
    - Common Name value used for the server and client certificates/keys must each differ from the Common Name value used for the CA certificate. Otherwise, the certificate and the key files will not work for the servers compiled using OpenSSL.

* **Email**
    - Email address.

* **Key length (bits)**
    - The key length in bits. 2048 and higher is recommended.

* **Expiration Date (days)**
    - Certificate expiration in days.

* **Generate**
    - Generate certificate and key.
    
* **Reset**
    - Reset the form.


Import
++++++

Import keys and certificates into ClusterControl's certificate repository. The imported keys and certificates can then be used to enable SSL encryption for server-client connection, replication or backup at a later stage. Before you perform the import action, bear in mind to:

1. Upload your certificate and key to a directory in the ClusterControl Controller host
2. Uncheck the *Self-signed Certificate* checkbox if the certificate is not self-signed
3. You need to also provide a CA certificate if the certificate is not self-signed
4. Duplicate certificates will not be created

* **Destination Path**
  - Where you want the certificate to be imported to. Click on the file explorer window on the left to change the path.

* **Save As**
  - Certificate name.

* **Certificate File**
  - Physical path to the certificate file. For example: ``/home/user/ssl/file.crt``.

* **Private Key File**
  - Physical path to the key file. For example: ``/home/user/ssl/file.key``.

* **Self-signed Certificate**
  - Uncheck the checkbox if the certificate is not self-signed.

* **Import**
  - Start the import process.

User Management
---------------
  
Teams
+++++

Manage teams (organizations) and users under ClusterControl. Take note that only the first user created with ClusterControl will be able to create the teams. You can have one or more teams and each team consists of zero or more clusters and users. You can have many roles defined under ClusterControl and a user must be assigned with one role.

As a roundup, here is how the different entities relate to each other:

.. image:: img/cc_erd.png
   :align: center

.. Note:: ClusterControl creates 'Admin' team by default.

Users
+++++

A user belongs to one team and assigned with a role. Users created here will be able to login and see specific cluster(s), depending on their team and the cluster they have been assigned to.

Each role is defined with specific privileges under *Access Control*. ClusterControl default roles are Super Admin, Admin and User:

=============== ============
Role            Description
=============== ============
**Super Admin** Able to see all clusters that are registered in the UI. The Super Admin can also create organizations and users. Only the Super Admin can transfer a cluster from one organization to another.
**Admin**       Belongs to a specific organization, and is able to see all clusters registered in that organization.
**User**        Belongs to a specific organization, and is only able to see the cluster(s) that he/she registered.
=============== ============

To create a custom role, see `Access Control`_.

Access Control
++++++++++++++

ClusterControl uses Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) to restrict access to clusters and their respective deployment, management and monitoring features. This ensures that only authorized user requests are allowed. Access to functionality is fine-grained, allowing access to be defined by organization or user. ClusterControl uses a permissions framework to define how a user may interact with the management and monitoring functionality, after they have been authorized to do so. 

You can create a custom role with its own set of access levels. Assign the role to specific user under *Teams* tab.

.. Note:: The **Super Admin** role is not listed since it is a default role and has the highest level of privileges in ClusterControl. 

Privileges

LDAP Settings
+++++++++++++

ClusterControl supports :term:`Active Directory`, :term:`FreeIPA` and :term:`LDAP` authentication. This allows users to log into ClusterControl by using their corporate credentials instead of a separate password. LDAP groups can be mapped onto ClusterControl user groups to apply roles to the entire group. It supports up to LDAPv3 protocol based on `RFC2307 <https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2307.txt>`_.

When authenticating, ClusterControl will first bind to the directory tree server ('LDAP Host') using the specified 'Login DN' user and password, then it will check if the username you entered exists in the form of uid, cn or sAMAccountName of the 'User DN'. If it exists, it will then use the username to bind against the LDAP server to check whether it has the configured group as in 'LDAP Group Name' in ClusterControl. If it does, ClusterControl will then map the user to the appropriate ClusterControl role and grant access to the UI.

The following flowchart summarizes the workflow:

.. image:: img/ipaad_flowchart.png
   :align: center

You can map the LDAP group to corresponding ClusterControl role created under *Access Control* tab. This would ensure that ClusterControl authorizes the logged-in user based on the role assigned.

Once the LDAP settings are verified, login into ClusterControl by using the LDAP credentials (uid, cn or sAMAccountName with respective password). User will be authenticated and redirected to ClusterControl dashboard page based on the assigned role. From this point, both ClusterControl and LDAP authentications would work.

.. Attention:: For Active Directory, ensure you configure the exact distinguished name (with proper capitalization) since the LDAP interchange format (LDIF) fields are returned in capital letters.

For example on how to setup OpenLDAP authentication with ClusterControl, please refer to this blog post, `How to Setup Centralized Authentication of ClusterControl Users with LDAP <http://www.severalnines.com/blog/how-setup-centralized-authentication-clustercontrol-users-ldap>`_.

LDAP Group
``````````

If LDAP authentication is enabled, you would need to map ClusterControl roles with their respective LDAP groups. You can configure this by clicking on the '+' icon to add an LDAP group:

+-----------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------+------------------------------------+
| Field           | Description                                                             | Example                            |
+=================+=========================================================================+====================================+
| Team            | The organization that you want the LDAP group to be assigned to.        | Admin                              |
+-----------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------+------------------------------------+
| LDAP Group Name | The distinguished name of the LDAP group, relative to the *Group DN*    | cn=Database Administrator,ou=group |
+-----------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------+------------------------------------+
| Role            | User role in ClusterControl. See `Teams`_.                              | Super Admin                        |
+-----------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------+------------------------------------+

Settings
``````````

* **Enable LDAP Authentication**
	- Choose whether to enable or disable LDAP authentication.

* **LDAP Host**
	- The LDAP server hostname or IP address. To use LDAP over SSL/TLS, specify LDAP URI instead, for example :samp:`ldaps://{LDAP_host}`.

* **LDAP Port**
	- Default is 389 and 636 for LDAP over SSL. Make sure to allow connections from ClusterControl host for both TCP and UDP protocol.

* **Base DN**
	- The root LDAP node under which all other nodes exist in the directory structure.

* **Login DN**
	- The distinguished name used to bind to the LDAP server. This is often the administrator or manager user. It can also be a dedicated login with minimal access that should be able to return the DN of the authenticating users. ClusterControl must do an LDAP search using this DN before any user can log in. This field is case-sensitive.

* **Password**
	- The password for the binding user specified in *Login DN*.

* **User DN**
	- The user's relative distinguished name (RDN) used to bind to the LDAP server. For example, if the LDAP user DN is CN=userA,OU=People,DC=ldap,DC=domain,DC=com, specify :samp:`OU=People,DC=ldap,DC=domain,DC=com`. This field is case-sensitive.

* **Group DN**
	- The group's relative distinguished name (RDN) used to bind to the LDAP server. For example, if the LDAP group DN is  CN=DBA,OU=Group,DC=ldap,DC=domain,DC=com, specify :samp:`OU=Group,DC=ldap,DC=domain,DC=com`. This field is case-sensitive.
	
.. Attention:: ClusterControl does not support binding against a nested directory group. Ensure each LDAP user that authenticates to ClusterControl has a direct membership to the LDAP group.

FreeIPA
````````

ClusterControl is able to bind to a :term:`FreeIPA` server and perform lookups on compatible schema. Once the :term:`DN` for that user is retrieved, it tries to bind using the full DN (in standard tree) with the entered password to verify the LDAP group of that user.

Thus, for FreeIPA, the user’s and group’s DN should use compatible schema, ``cn=compat`` replacing the default ``cn=accounts`` in ClusterControl LDAP Settings except for the 'Login DN', as shown in following screenshot:

.. image:: img/ipaad_set_ipa.png
   :align: center

For example on integrating ClusterControl with FreeIPA and Windows Active Directory, please refer to this blog post, `Integrating ClusterControl with FreeIPA and Windows Active Directory for Authentication <http://severalnines.com/blog/integrating-clustercontrol-freeipa-and-windows-active-directory-authentication>`_.

Clusters
++++++++

Manage database clusters inside ClusterControl.

* **Delete** 
	- Unregister the selected database cluster from the ClusterControl UI. This action will **NOT** delete the actual database cluster.

* **Change Team** 
	- Change the selected database cluster to another organization created under `Teams`_.
