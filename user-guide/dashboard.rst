*Cluster List*

List of database clusters managed by ClusterControl with summarized status. Database cluster deployed by (or added into) ClusterControl will be listed in this page. See `Database Cluster List`_ section.

*Cluster Actions*

Provides shortcuts to main cluster functionality. 

Every supported database cluster has its own set of functionality:
	- `MySQL <mysql/overview.html#actions>`_
	- `MongoDB <mongodb/overview.html#actions>`_
	- `PostgreSQL <postgresql/overview.html#actions>`_

Deploy Database Cluster
------------------------

Opens a step-by-step wizard to deploy a new set of database cluster. The following database cluster types are supported:

* MySQL Replication
* MySQL Galera
	* MySQL Galera Cluster
	* Percona XtraDB Cluster
	* MariaDB Galera Cluster
* MySQL Group Replication (beta)
* MySQL Cluster (NDB)
* MongoDB ReplicaSet
* MongoDB Sharded Cluster
* PostgreSQL Replication

There are prerequisites that need to be fulfilled prior to the deployment:

* Verify that sudo is working properly if you are using a non-root user.
* Passwordless SSH is configured from ClusterControl node to all database nodes.

For more details, refer to the `Requirements <../requirements.html>`_ section. Each time you create a database cluster, ClusterControl will trigger a job under *ClusterControl > Activity > Jobs*. You can see the progress and status under this page.

MySQL Replication
`````````````````

Deploys a new MySQL Replication. The database cluster will be automatically added into ClusterControl once deployed. Minimum of two nodes is required for MySQL Replication. If only one MySQL IP address or hostname is defined, ClusterControl will deploy it as a standalone MySQL server.

Starting from version 1.4.0, it's possible to setup a master-master replication from scratch under 'Define Topology' tab. You can add more slaves later after the deployment completes.

.. Caution:: ClusterControl sets ``read_only=1`` on all slaves but a privileged user (SUPER) can still write to a slave (except for MySQL version that supports ``super_read_only``).

1) General & SSH Settings
''''''''''''''''''''''''''

* **SSH User**
	- Specify root if you have root credentials.
	- If you use 'sudo' to execute system commands, specify the name that you wish to use here. The user must exists on all nodes. See `Operating System User <../requirements.html#operating-system-user>`_.
	
* **SSH Key Path**
	- Specify the full path of SSH key (the key must exist in ClusterControl node) that will be used by *SSH User* to perform passwordless SSH. See `Passwordless SSH <../requirements.html#passwordless-ssh>`_.

* **Sudo Password**
	- If you use sudo with password, specify it here. Ignore this if *SSH User* is root or sudoer does not need a sudo password.

* **SSH Port**
	- Specify the SSH port for target nodes. ClusterControl assumes SSH is running on the same port on all nodes.
	
* **Cluster Name**
	- Specify a name for the cluster.

* **Install Software**
  - Check the box if you use clean and minimal VMs. Existing MySQL dependencies will be removed. New packages will be installed and existing packages will be uninstalled when provisioning the node with required software.
  - If unchecked, existing packages will not be uninstalled, and nothing will be installed. This requires that the instances have already provisioned the necessary software.

* **Disable Firewall**
	- Check the box to disable firewall (recommended).

* **Disable AppArmor/SELinux**
	- Check the box to let ClusterControl disable AppArmor (Ubuntu) or SELinux (RedHat/CentOS) if enabled (recommended).

2) Define MySQL Servers
'''''''''''''''''''''''
    
* **Vendor**
	- Percona XtraDB - Percona Server by Percona
	- MariaDB - MariaDB Server by MariaDB
	- Oracle - MySQL Server by Oracle

* **Version**
	- Select the MySQL version for new deployment. For Oracle, only 5.7 is supported. For Percona, 5.6 and 5.7 are available. If you choose MariaDB, only 10.1 is supported.

* **Server Data Directory**
	- Location of MySQL data directory. Default is ``/var/lib/mysql``.
	
* **Server Port**
	- MySQL server port. Default is 3306.

	- MySQL configuration template file under ``/usr/share/cmon/templates``. Default is ``my.cnf.repl[version]``. Keep the default is recommended.
	
* **Admin/Root Password**
	- Specify MySQL root password. ClusterControl will configure the same MySQL root password for all instances in the cluster.

* **Repository**
	- Use Vendor Repositories - Provision software by setting up and using the database vendor's preferred software repository. ClusterControl will always install the latest version of what is provided by database vendor repository.
	- Do Not Setup Vendor Repositories - Provision software by using repositories already setup on the nodes. The User has to set up the software repository manually on each database node and ClusterControl will use this repository for deployment. This is good if the database nodes are running without internet connections.
	- Use Mirrored Repositories - Create and mirror the current database vendor's repository and then deploy using the local mirrored repository. This is a preferred option when you have to scale the Galera Cluster in the future, to ensure the newly provisioned node will always have the same version as the rest of the members.

3) Define Topology
'''''''''''''''''''

* **Master A - IP/Hostname**
	- Specify the IP address of the primary MySQL master node.
	
* **Add slaves to master A**

* **Add slaves to master B**
	- Only available if you click *Add Second Master Node*.
	- Add a slave node connected to master B. Press 'Enter' to add more slave.
	
* **Deploy**

MySQL Galera 
`````````````

Deploys a new MySQL Galera Cluster. The database cluster will be automatically added into ClusterControl once deployed.

Import Existing Server/Cluster
--------------------------------

Opens a wizard to import the existing database setup into ClusterControl. The following database cluster types are supported:

* MySQL Replication
* MySQL Galera
	* MySQL Galera Cluster
	* Percona XtraDB Cluster
	* MariaDB Galera Cluster
* MySQL Cluster (NDB)
* MongoDB ReplicaSet
* MongoDB Shards
* PostgreSQL (standalone or replication)

There are some prerequisites that need to be fulfilled prior to adding the existing setup. The existing database cluster/server must:

* Verify that sudo is working properly if you are using a non-root user
* Passwordless SSH from ClusterControl node to database nodes has been configured correctly
* The target server/cluster must not in degraded state. For example, if you have a three-node Galera cluster, all nodes must alive and in synced.

For more details, refer to the `Requirement <../requirements.html>`_ section. Each time you add an existing cluster or server, ClusterControl will trigger a job under *ClusterControl > Settings > Cluster Jobs*. You can see the progress and status under this page. A window will also appear with messages showing the progress.

Import Existing MySQL Replication
``````````````````````````````````

ClusterControl is able to manage/monitor an existing set of MySQL servers (standalone or replication). Individual hosts specified in the same list will be added to the same server group in the UI. ClusterControl assumes that you are using the same MySQL root password for all instances specified in the group and it will attempt to determine the server role as well (master, slave, multi or standalone).

1) General & SSH Settings
''''''''''''''''''''''''''

* **SSH User**
	- Specify root if you have root credentials.
	- If you use 'sudo' to execute system commands, specify the name that you wish to use here. The user must exists on all nodes. See `Operating System User <../requirements.html#operating-system-user>`_.
	
* **SSH Key Path**
	- Specify the full path of SSH key (the key must exist in ClusterControl node) that will be used by *SSH User* to perform passwordless SSH. See `Passwordless SSH <../requirements.html#passwordless-ssh>`_.

* **Sudo Password**
	- Specify the password if the SSH user that you specified under *SSH User* requires sudo password to run super-privileged commands. Ignore this if *SSH User* is root or have no sudo password.
	
* **SSH Port**
	- Specify the SSH port for target nodes. ClusterControl assumes SSH is running on the same port on all nodes.
