Maintenance Release: Feb 24th, 2018
````````````````````````````````````

* Build:
	- clustercontrol-controller-1.5.1-2390
	- clustercontrol-1.5.1-4395

* Controller:
	- PostgreSQL: Fixed a bug in the PostgreSQL config parsing causing a syntax error using ``include``.
	- Advisors: Bug fixes and corrections
	- MySQL Cluster: Fixed a number of issues around hostnames and port settings, which caused node types (data node, management node) to be improperly identified.
	- Backup (Verify Backup): Fixed a number of issues handling the Backup Verification Server.
	- Backup (Verify Backup): A backup verification email is now sent when the backup has been verified.
	- Operational Reports: Availability report issues. The ``cluster_events``/``node_events`` tables were inadvertently dropped during ClusterControl upgrades causing the stats to be reset.
	- PostgreSQL: ``pg_basebackup`` executed on a slave failed on imported clusters due to a missing grant.
	- Remove Node: Fixes to make it possible to only unregister a node (remove the node from ClusterControl management).
	- Schema: DB schema fixes to the ``server_node`` properties column by extending the size.
	- Galera/Group Replication: properly write/update the cmon_X.cnf ``mysql_server_addresses`` field to mark non galera|group_repl nodes there correctly.

	- Remove Node: Improved consistency in ‘Remove Node’’ dialogs.
	- MySQL/Galera: New default value for binary logging path which is now outside of the datadir.
	- Backup (MySQL based clusters): Fixed an issue where Backup Method and Backup Host drop-downs were empty.
	- Deploy/Import/Add Node: Improved Host Discovery showing the actual SSH error.
	- Deploy/Import: SSH Key Path validation was missing.
	- Charts: It was possible to select a negative range (smaller end date than start date).
	- MongoDB: Add Shards dialog got stuck when entering a hostname (SSH check never terminated).

Maintenance Release: Feb 6th, 2018
````````````````````````````````````

* Build:
	- clustercontrol-controller-1.5.1-2362
	- clustercontrol-1.5.1-4356

* Controller:
	- Stats: RAM stats updated to also account for *SReclaimable*.

	- Error Reporter: include more info about PostgreSQL clusters (``pg_stat_replication`` table + recovery config file)
	- MySQL: Fixed an issue handling ``!include`` directives containing quotes. The import config job (automatically executed upon a controller restart) will auto-correct broken MySQL ``!include`` directives containing quotes.

* Frontend/UI:
	- Deployment/Import dialogs: Added validation for SSH Key Path.
	- ProxySQL: Filter users with unrelated hosts when deploying ProxySQL.
	- MongoDB: Fixed a problem specifying hostnames when performing "Add Shard".

Maintenance Release: Jan 29th, 2018
````````````````````````````````````

* Build:
	- clustercontrol-controller-1.5.1-2346

* Controller
	- Galera: A path to a ``node_recovery_lock_file`` can now be specified in ``/etc/cmon.d/cmon_N.cnf``. If set and the lock file is found on the node then the node recovery will fail until an admin/script removes this file. The cmon controller process must be restarted when this parameter has been specified. This feature maybe useful for encrypted filesystems.
	- MySQL Cluster (NDB): Fix to allow deployments on other ports than 3306.
	- MySQL: Error code 2013 (lost connection during query) is not a reason to set a node into disconnected state.
	- MySQL: Fixed up handling of ``ignore-db-dir`` in config templates on MySQL 5.5 based servers 
	- ProxySQL: Improve ProxySQL support such that ``admin-admin_credentials`` may contain multiple credentials

Initial Release: Dec 22nd, 2017
````````````````````````````````

* Build:
	- clustercontrol-1.5.1-4265
	- clustercontrol-controller-1.5.1-2299

In this release we have added support to optionally use our built-in AES-256 encryption for your backups. Secure your backups for offsite or cloud storage with a flip of a checkbox.

We have also added an option to use a custom retention period per backup schedule.

There is a new Topology view (BETA) initially with MySQL based clusters to show a replication topology (incl. any load balancers) for your cluster. Use drag and drop to perform node actions, for example drag a replication slave on top of a master node which will prompt you to either rebuild the slave or change the replication master.

A new left side navigation bar provides faster page access to some of our features and the node actions are now also accessible directly from the node list.

**Feature Details**

* AES-256 Backup Encryption (and Restore):
	- Supported backup methods:
		- mysqldump, xtrabackup (MySQL).
		- pg_dump, pg_basebackup (PostgreSQL).
		- mongodump (MongoDB).

* Topology View (BETA):
	- MySQL Replication Topology.
	- MySQL Galera Topology.

* MongoDB
	- Support for MongoDB v3.4.
	- Fix to add back restore from backup.
	- Multiple NICs support. Management/public IPs for monitoring connections and data/private IPs for replication traffic.

In this release we have started to add integrations with cloud services and initially plan to add support for the major public cloud providers - Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud and Azure.

We are reintroducing backup to the cloud where you can now manually upload or schedule backups to be stored on AWS S3 and Google Cloud Storage. You can then download and restore backups from the cloud in case of local backup storage disasters or if you need to reduce local disk space usage for your backups.

For MySQL based clusters we have added support for MariaDB 10.2 and you can now choose to initially stage a slave from an existing backup instead of staging from a master. Individual databases (mysqldump only) can be backed up with separate dumps/files, and you can trigger verification/restoring of a backup to happen after N hours after a scheduled backup has completed.

PostgreSQL has an additional backup method ``pg_basebackup`` that can be used for online binary backups. Backups taken with ``pg_basebackup`` can be used later for point-in-time recovery and as the starting point for a log shipping or streaming replication standby servers. We have also added support for synchronous replication failover and deploying HAProxy with Keepalived (for load balancing HA) to be used with PostgreSQL clusters.

Load balancers (HAProxy) can be deployed by explicitly selecting the public/management IP for connecting and provisioning the software. Especially useful for cloud environments if you are provisioning/managing over a public network.

We also have some additional improvements for ProxySQL. You can add or modify schedulers and also mass import existing database users into your ProxySQL instances to quickly setup access.

**Feature Details**

* Cloud Services (AWS S3 and Google Cloud Storage):
	- Manual upload or schedule backups to be uploaded after completion to the cloud.
	- Download and restore backups from a cloud storage.

* Backup (MySQL):
	- Backup individual databases separately (mysqldump only).
	- Upload, download and restore backups stored in the cloud.
	- Trigger a verification and restore of a backup after N hours of completion.
	- Rebuild a replication slave by staging it from an existing backup.
	- Add a new replication slave by staging it from an existing backup.

* PostgreSQL:
	- New backup method ``pg_basebackup`` which makes a binary copy of the database files.
	- Synchronous replication failover (support for ``synchronous_standby_names``).
	- Support for HAProxy with Keepalived.
	- Support for PostgreSql 10.

* ProxySQL:
	- Mass import existing database users into ProxySQL.
	- Add and modify scheduler scripts.

New options: ``schema_change_detection_address``, ``schema_change_detection_databases``, ``schema_change_detection_pause_time_ms`` must be set in ``/etc/cmon.d/cmon_X.cnf`` to enable the feature. A new Operation Report (Schema Change) must be scheduled. 
	- Creating a report of 100 000 schemas and tables will take about 5-10 minutes depending on hardware. Configure the ``schema_change_detection_address`` to run on a replication slave or an async slave connected to e.g a Galera or Group Replication Cluster. For NDB this ``schema_change_detection_address`` should be set to a MySQL server used for admin purposes. Throttle the detection process with ``schema_change_detection_pause_time_ms. schema_change_detection_databases`` is a comma separated string of database names and also supports wildcards, e.g 'DB%', will evaluate all database starting with DB.

    - New "Install Software" option for Galera Cluster with "Create Database Cluster" and "Create Database Node"
    - Default "Yes" act as before where ClusterControl provisions the database nodes with required packages and any existing packages could be uninstalled if required.
    - If set to "No" then no provisioning of packages or uninstallation of any existing packages are done. It is assumed that the DB nodes have been provisioned by for example a configuration management system with all required database packages. The create cluster/node jobs will then only provision out our Galera my.cnf file and then bootstrap the cluster without doing any provisioning of software. It is important that the mysql server process is stopped before running the job with "install Software" set to "No".
		- MongoDB arbiter is now shown on the "Nodes" page

* Key Management allows you to manage a set of SSL certificates and keys that can be provisioned on your clusters
    - Create certificate authority certificates or self-signed certificates and keys
    - Easily Enable and Disable SSL encrypted client-server connections for MySQL and Postgres based clusters

* Additional Operational Reports
    - Generate an Availability Summary of uptime/downtime for your managed clusters and see node availability and cluster state history during the reported period
    - Generate a backup summary of backup success/failure rates for your managed clusters 

* Improved Security
    - From this version we are setting an unique Controller RPC API Token which enables token authentication for your managed clusters. No user intervention is needed when upgrading older ClusterControl versions. An unique token will be automatically generated, set and enabled for existing clusters.
    - Custom scripts/applications utilizing the RPC API need to pass the correct token for the clusters, see http://severalnines.com/downloads/cmon/cmon-docs/current/ccrpc.html... for details on how to pass the token correctly. 

* Create/Mirror Repository
    - Mirror your database vendor’s software repository without having to actually deploy a cluster. A mirrored local repository is used in scenarios where you cannot upgrade a cluster and must lock the db versions to use.

* Additional Backup Retention Periods
    - Enable shorter retention periods

* MySQL based clusters
    - NDB/MySQL Cluster
        - Create a production setup of NDB/MySQL Cluster from ClusterControl
        - Deploy Management Nodes, SQL/API Nodes and Data Nodes

	- clustercontrol-1.2.12-1007
	- clustercontrol-cmonapi-1.2.12-156
	- clustercontrol-controller-1.2.12-1096
	- clustercontrol-nodejs-1.2.12-51

* Operational Reports (BETA). Generate, schedule and email out operational reports. The current default report shows a cluster's health and performance at the time it was generated compared 1 day ago.
	- The report provides information on Node availability, Backup summary, Top queries, Host and Node stats. We will add more options and report types in future releases.

* Custom Advisor dialog. Create threshold based advisors with host or MySQL stats without needing to write your own JS script.

* Notification Services (new clustercontrol-nodejs package). Currently only email and pagerduty notifications are used by custom advisors. More to come. 

* Local Mirrored Repository. Create a local mirror of a database vendor's software repository. This allows you to "freeze" the current versions of the software packages used to provision a database cluster for a specific vendor and you can later use that mirrored repository to provision the same set of versions when adding more nodes or deploying other clusters.

* Export graphs as CSV, XLS files

* Search the content in the system logs

Changes in v1.2.10
------------------

*May 27th, 2015*

* Introducing our new powerful ClusterControl DSL (Domain Specific Language) which allows you to create Advisors, AutoTuners or "mini Programs" on our ClusterControl platform! (BETA)
	- JavaScript based language syntax (not 100% JavaScript compatible) with extensions to provide access to ClusterControl's internal data structures and functions!
	- Allows you to execute SQL statements and/or run shell commands/programs across all your cluster hosts and retrieve results to be processed for advisors/alerts/actions etc.
	- SDK documentation 

* Integrated Developer's Studio (Developer IDE)
	- Provides a simple but elegant environment to quickly create/edit, compile, run/test and schedule your JS programs. 

* ClusterControl Advisors/JS bundle for MySQL based clusters - feel free to modify and share your changes with the community!
	- A set of basic advisors with rules, alerts and actions that you can use as a base for your own customizations.

* Import ClusterControl JS bundles from the community or our partners. 
* Export ClusterControl JS bundles for others to use/try out. 
* Galera Cluster
	- Create a Galera Cluster with up to 9 nodes for local/on-premise deployments.
	- New cluster action that shows you the most advanced (last committed) node in your cluster, simplifying manual cluster recovery.
	- Show long running and deadlocked transactions, great for performance tuning.
	- Actions that can be performed on a Node is now also available directly from the overview page.
	- New Add Node option to Add an Existing DB Node, i.e., a node that has been provisioned without ClusterControl.  
* MySQL Replication clusters using GTIDs support Failover and Slave Promotion (manual). 
* Overview page's cluster load graph and the Nodes's page graphs have been migrated to use the faster CMON RPC API.
* Configuration Management uses the CMON RPC API to manage configurations.
* General frontend optimizations for better UI performance.
* Fixed bugs in the SSL/TLS email protocol

Changes in v1.2.9
-----------------

*Feb 8th, 2015*

* MySQL Replication (master <-> master) should not upgrade.
* Support for PostgreSQL Servers!
	- Add Existing PostgreSQL Server (standalone). Only v9.x supported. 
	- Monitor and schedule backups
	- Query Monitor

* Port 9500 must be open on the controller for internal communication between UI and the CMON process
* Port 9999 (by default) must be open bi-directionally between controller and data nodes for streaming backups (mysqldumps, xtrabackup, pgdump)
* Galera Cluster
	- Bootstrap Cluster. Select a DB node to initialize the cluster from. Optionally enable/force SST for joining nodes and forcefully stop (SIGKILL) nodes
	- Stop Cluster forcefully (SIGKILL) or with a graceful shutdown time
	- Start DB node. Optionally enable SST at startup
	- Stop DB node forcefully (SIGKILL) or with a graceful shutdown time 
	- Make a non-primary DB node primary
	- Replication Slave Setup for Galera Cluster (GTID support). Slaves are bootstrapped with a Xtrabackup stream from a chosen Master
	- Failover replication (GTID only) slave from to a new master
	- Stage replication slave from master (Xtrabackup streamed from master to slave), useful in event of slave corruption
	- Enable SSL Replication Encryption on the Galera Cluster. 2048-bit default key and certificate generated on the ClusterControl node and transferred to all the Galera nodes automatically
	- SSL support between controller and managed nodes
	- wsrep-recover is used to discover the most advanced Galera Node for recovery operations
	- Removed manipulation of wsrep_cluster_address in my.cnf files meaning ClusterControl no longer makes any alterations of a node's configuration file
	- Backup functionality completely re-written, and netcat port for streaming backups is user specified
	- Restore ClusterControl originated or external made backups on selected hosts
	- Alarm is raised if a node has set wsrep_cluster_address=gcomm://
	- Improved logging and hints to assist with failed recovery attempts
	- Enable/Disable Node/Cluster Auto Recovery from UI

* Advanced HAProxy Deployment Settings 
	- Set for example client and server timeouts, max connections for frontend and backend. Select which backend servers are 'active' or 'backup'
	- It is possible to enable/disable nodes part of a load balancer.
	- Built-in HAProxy Statistics. No longer need to launch separate window to monitor the HAProxy performance
	- Template configuration is stored on the controller in /usr/share/cmon/templates/haproxy,cfg ,  mysqlchk.*, and mysqlchk_xinetd and allows for pre-install modifications.

* Deadlock and long running queries detection
	- ``db_long_query_time_alarm`` (specify in cmon.cnf). If a query takes longer than ``db_long_query_time_alarm`` to execute an alarm will be raised containing detailed information about blocked and long running transactions. ``db_long_query_time_alarm = 0`` (disable), default value 5

* MySQL Replication / Single MySQL Server
	- Failover replication (GTID only) slave from to a new master
	- Stage replication slave from master (Xtrabackup streamed from master to slave), useful in event of slave corruption

* MongoDB Cluster
	- New Overview page with global lock stats.

* A new more “modern” front-end theme
	- Re-organized Cluster specific actions into an easy to access list.
	- A global alarm list which shows alarms per cluster. No need to drill into each cluster to see the alarms anymore. 

* Deprecated scripts (most of the below functionalities are now handled directly by the Controller process):

		- cmondb_ssl_key= path to SSL key, for SSL encryption between CMON and the CMON DB.
		- cmondb_ssl_cert = path to SSL cert, for SSL encryption between CMON and the CMON DB
		- cmondb_ssl_ca = path to SSL CA, for SSL encryption between CMON and the CMON DB
		- cluster_ssl_key= path to SSL key, for SSL encryption between CMON and managed MySQL Servers.
		- cluster_ssl_cert = path to SSL cert, for SSL encryption between CMON and managed MySQL Servers.
		- cluster_ssl_ca = path to SSL CA, for SSL encryption between CMON and managed MySQL Servers.
		- cluster_certs_store = path to storage location of SSL related files, defaults to ``/etc/ssl/<clustertype>/<cluster_id>``
	- Monitoring:
		- New binary format for host statistics which consumes less space (cpu, memory, disk, network stats).
		- Fixed disk statistics collector to support non 4K block sizes.
	- Security:
		- E-mails do not contain IP addresses when hostnames are specified in the cmon configuration
		- Password will not be logged (to jobs for example) or sent anymore
	- Alarms:
		- Alarm will be raised when there is a missing MySQL GRANT
		- Alarm will be raised/sent when there is a high IO wait for a period (>=50% average in 10 minutes)
		- New alarm for Galera configuration problems
		- Improved alarm emails (for example: high cpu/mem usage mails will contain the output of 'top' command)
	- RPC:
		- Several new RPC interfaces (directly on the daemon) for jobs and statistics handling
		- The web client has started to migrate over to use RPC API calls instead of the CMON API
	- Testing:
		- Acceptance testsuite which runs daily using vm instances

* Other:
	- Job failures are much better explained
	- Huge refactor for cluster handling, it is now mostly unified
	- Improved host/node handling (makes it possible later on to add support for multiple services on a single host)
	- Better CentOS7 / systemd support
	- cmon init script updates (and unified across distros [redhat/debian])
	- Support for more detailed SSH logging if needed
	- Agents are no longer supported
