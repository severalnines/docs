Developer Guide
===============

This documentation provides detailed information for developers to manipulate and externds ClusterControl functionalities via its Remote Procedure Calls (RPC) interfaces or ClusterControl Domain Specific Language (DSL). 

.. _CMON RPC:

CMON RPC
--------

ClusterControl provides RPC interfaces for the CMON controller, and these interfaces are exposed in two different versions:

* |rpc_v1_external_link|
* |rpc_v2_external_link|

.. |rpc_v1_external_link| raw:: html

   <a href="https://severalnines.com/downloads/cmon/cmon-docs/current/ccrpc.html" target="_blank">RPCv1</a>

.. |rpc_v2_external_link| raw:: html

   <a href="https://severalnines.com/downloads/cmon/cmon-docs/current/rpcv2.html" target="_blank">RPCv2</a>

It's recommended to use the RPC v2, whenever possible. Please note that the RPC v2 API calls are available only using secure (TLS) connections, encryption is mandatory. The RPC v2 also uses an authentication call, very little of the calls are available to be used without authenticating first.

By default the encrypted communication can be used through port 9501 and the RPC v2 requests are server served on the ``/v2`` path (e.g. ``/v2/clusters``).

.. _ClusterControl DSL:

ClusterControl DSL
------------------

The DSL syntax is similar to JavaScript, with extensions to provide access to ClusterControl's internal data structures and functions. The CCDSL allows you to execute SQL statements, run shell commands/programs across all your cluster hosts, and retrieve results to be processed for advisors/alerts or any other actions.

Introduction
++++++++++++

This language will be provided for the users, to implement monitoring related code in a language similar to JavaScript. The code is executed on the Cmon Controller and will have access to the cluster nodes through the network.

The language is different from JavaScript in some ways. Here is a list of the most important differences:

* Semicolons are mandatory like in C or C++.
* Not all numbers are handled as double precision floating point values, we have integers and even usigned long long integers. We need those to handle disk sizes and network traffic measured in bytes.
* There are associative arrays with the data type ``Map``.
* The arrays are two dimensional, but they can be used as one dimensional arrays (e.g. a[10, 11] and a[10] are also valid).
* We have a ``List`` type.
* JavaScript uses a period in function names like ``JSON.parse(text)``, here we use the C++ notation like ``JSON::parse(text)``.
* New variables created on-the-fly in functions are local variables and not globals.
* The language implements a C like #include preprocessor directive.

Supported ClusterControl Controller (CMON) version: 1.7.0.

Language basics
+++++++++++++++

Preprocessor directives
````````````````````````

This system has no preprocessor, the parsing is done in one stage. Some expressions however are implemented the same way it is implemented in most of the C/C++ language preprocessors. Here is a list of the supported preprocessor directives.

* ``#include "filepath"``
	Preprocessor directive to include a source file the same way it is used for the C/C++ languages.

* ``#pragma once``
	Preprocessor directive to protect an include file to be included multiple times. The same as in the C/C++ languages.

Types
`````

Here is an example of the new operator.

.. code-block:: javascript

  var a = new Int;
  var b = new CmonHost();
  passed = 
    a === 0 &&
    b.typeName() == "CmonHost";


* Int
* Bool
* Double
* Ulonglong
* String
* Error
* Map
* List
* Array
* CmonHost
* CmonMySqlHost
* CmonPostgreSqlHost
* CmonGaleraHost
* CmonMongoHost
* CmonMaxScaleHost
* CmonAdvice
* CmonClusterConfig
* CmonGraph
* CmonJob

Literals
````````

**Boolean literals**. These are just simply ``true`` and ``false``.

**String literals**. The string literals are handled the usual way, they can be enclosed in single or double quotes, single quoted strings may contain double quotes, the double quoted strings can contain single quotes.

.. code-block:: javascript

	var carName1 = "Volvo XC60";
	var carName2 = 'Volvo XC60';
	var answer1 = "It's alright";
	var answer2 = "He is called 'Johnny'";
	var answer3 = 'He is called "Johnny"';

Strings literals can also be concatenated in compile time as it is seen in the C/C++ languages:

.. code-block:: javascript

  var a = 
    "one "
    "two "
    "three";
  passed = a == "one two three";

**Integer literals.** Integer literals are integer numbers that are fit to be stored in the host computers "int" type. Here is an example:

.. code-block:: javascript

	var1 = 0xff;
	var2 = 0XFFFF;
	passed = var1 == 255 && var2 == 65535;

**Unsigned long long literals.** If an integer literal is too big to fit on an "int" type but fits in an unsigned long long it is automatically stored in an unsigned long long (or "Ulonglong" type). If the number is prefixed with "ull" it is also considered to have the Ulonglong type.

.. code-block:: javascript

  var a = 91872698761001;
  var b = 10ull;
  passed = 
    a.typeName() == "Ulonglong" &&
    b.typeName() == "Ulonglong";

**Double literals.** All the numbers that are not fit to any integer types will be stored in a double type as the usual double format strings.

.. code-block:: javascript

  var a = 10.2;
  var b = 10.8E11;
  var c = 2.8e-10;
  passed = 
    a.typeName() == "Double" &&
    b.typeName() == "Double" &&
    c.typeName() == "Double";

**Error literals.**

.. code-block:: javascript

  var a = #ARGS!;
  passed = a === #ARGS!;

The available error literals are the following:

* #NULL!
	Null value error.

* #DIV/0!
	Division by zero.

* #VALUE!
	Type mismatch error e.g. log of a string.

* #REF!
	Invalid variable reference, missing variable.

* #NAME?
	The name was not found, e.g. a function name is invalid.

* #NUM!
	Invalid numerical value e.g. sqrt(-1).

* #N/A
	Value is not available.

* #SYNTAX!
	Syntax error in formula.

* #ARGS!
	Argument number for a function is invalid.

**Map literals.** Map literals are associative arrays that can hold any type of values (even maps) and can be indexed by strings. Here is an example how to create and use a map:

.. code-block:: javascript

  var a = {};
  a["one"] = {};
  a["one"]["two"] = "value";
  passed = 
    a.typeName() == "Map" &&
    a["one"]["two"] == "value";

The map keys could be listed using the ``.keys()`` method:

.. code-block:: javascript

  // an example iteration on the map:
  var testmap = {};
  testmap["key1"] = "test";
  testmap["key2"] = "test";
  keys = testmap.keys();
  for (i = 0; i < keys.size(); ++i)
  {
     print (keys[i] + ": " + testmap[keys[i]]);
  }

**Regular expression literals.** Regular expression literals are supported the same way they are supported by the JavaScript language. Here is an example that demonstrates the usage of such literals:

.. code-block:: javascript

  var regexp = /([0-9]+)x([0-9]+)/i;
  var string = "s: 640x480";
  string.replace(regexp, "$2x$1");
  // string === "s: 480x640";

Regular expressions has the type CmonRegExp.


Functions
+++++++++

If the function is called with the wrong number of arguments the return value will be an ``#ARGS!`` error (the type of the return value will be "Error").

JSON Functions
``````````````

* ``Map JSON::parse(text)``
    Parses a JSon string and returns it in a Map format.

* ``String JSon::toString(map)``
    Converts object (a constructed Map object) to a well formatted JSon string.

* ``String JSON::postRequest(url, map)``
    Sends a POST request to the specified URL using JSonized value of the 'map'.

An example reply/request:

.. code-block:: javascript

  var req = new Map;
  req["operation"] = "clusters";
  var retval = JSON::postRequest("http://localhost:9500/0/clusters", req);
  print ("retval of clusters:\n" + retval);

And the raw reply:

              }
              ],
              "status": "Ended"
          },
          "success": true

Except if the ``exit()`` function is used to set the exit status.

.. code-block:: javascript

  var global1 = 10;
  function main(arg1)
  {
    return 
      arg1 == "UtCmonImperative" &&
      global1 === 10 &&
      global2 === 11;
  }
  var global2 = 11;

	* ``%E`` - A multi line description of the advice that contain multiple properties.


CmonJob Functions
````````````````````````

The CmonJob type represents a job or a task that the Cmon controller can execute. These jobs are usually executed asynchronously. The script creates a job, stores all the necessary information in the CmonJob object and pushes into the execution queue. Then the controller executes the job and sends its results to the UI where the user can check what happened.

The CmonJob type is supported from version 1.2.11 of Cmon.

General Job Functions

* ``Bool job.enqueue()``
    Checks the job for consistency and sends it to the execution queue. Returns true if everything went well.

* ``String job.errorString()``
    Returns the human readable error string describing the error or the empty string if there were no errors.

* ``Int job.jobId()``
    Returns the unique numerical ID for the job. Only jobs that are enqueued for execution has valid (greater than 0) IDs.

* ``CmonJob CmonJob::createDoCheckJob()``
    Creates a job that will trigger some checks on the controller. These checks can be used to see if there are duplicate indexes, missing indexes, database schema issues on the production system. More checks will be added later.

* ``Bool job.setBackupMethod(method)``
    Sets what kind of backup will be created, what software will be used to create the backup file. Returns true if the job is valid, all the properties are in order. Currently the following methods are supported:

  * "auto" - To use the default backup software for the given cluster type. (This means mysqldump now).
  * "none" - This is the same as "auto".
  * "mysqldump" - Use the mysqldump program to create a backup.
  * "xtrabackupfull" - Use the xtrabackup program to create a full (not incremental) backup.
  * "xtrabackupincr" - Use the xtrabackup program to create an incremental backup.
  * "pgdump" - Backup method for PostgreSQL hosts using the pg_dump or pg_dumpall programs.

* ``Bool job.setCompression(compression)``
    Sets if the created backup file should be compressed.

* ``Bool job.setIncludeDatabases(value)``
    Sets which databases should be processed.

    Sets if the Cmon Controller should store the backup file.

* ``Bool job.setNetcatPort(value)``
    Sets the netcat port that is used when copying the backup file through the network.

The following example shows how easy and simple to create a job that will create a backup of the data found on one specific host.

.. code-block:: javascript

  //
  // This program will create a backup job using two strings, one for hostname and
  // one for directory name. Then the backup method is set (teh default value is
  // "auto") and the job is send for execution.
  //
  var job = CmonJob::createBackupJob("127.0.0.1", "/var/tmp");
  var passed;
  job.setBackupMethod("mysqldump");
  passed = job.enqueue();
  if (passed !== true)
  {
      error("ERROR: ", job.errorString());
      exit(false);
  }


Cluster Configuration Jobs
''''''''''''''''''''''''''

Some functions change the state or configuration of the cluster. Adding and removing nodes, starting and stopping nodes or the entire cluster are the most important jobs in this section.

* ``CmonJob CmonJob::createAddNodeJob(hostName, [install], [configFile])``
    Creates a job that ultimately will add a new node to the cluster. The node is identified by the host name passed as the first argument. If the second argument is true the database software is also installed on the new node and so the third argument must be the file name of the configuration file template.

	Registers a new alarm type if an alarm type with the same properties is not registered already. Returns the alarm type that can be used to raise and clear alarms with these properties. Use this function to implement custom alarms for the Cmon system. Please check the `Alarms`_ section for examples.

* ``int Alarm::checkId(category, isHost, warningLevel, criticalLevel, title, message, recommendation)``
	Registers a new check type if a check type with the same properties is not registered already. Checks are in reality alarms that have warning and critical levels so they can easily be used to check numerical values.

The Cmon Database is the SQL database where the Cmon stores all its internal data. This database is accessible from the JS programs.

* ``Map CmonDb::executeSqlQuery(query)``
	Executes the SQL query on the Cmon Database and returns the results. The returned map will have values for the keys "success", "errorMessage" and "result" where the value for the "result" is a two dimensional array that holds the values from the SQL query.

Examples
++++++++

Executing SQL commands and queries
````````````````````````````````````````````````

The following example demonstrates how to execute an SQL query on an arbitrary host of a cluster and receive the results in an array. The return value of the ``host.executeSqlQuery()`` holds the success/failed status of the query, the error message and also the results in a two dimensional array.

.. code-block:: c++
  
  function getSqlVariable(host, variableName)
  {
    var query = "SHOW GLOBAL STATUS LIKE '$1'";
    var retval;
    var value;
    if (host.typeName() != "CmonHost")
      return #ARGS!;
    query.replace("$1", variableName);
    retval = host.executeSqlQuery(query);
    if (!retval["success"])
    {
      print("ERROR:", retval["errorMessage"]);
      return #N/A;
    }
    value = retval["result"][0, 1];
    if (value.looksInteger())
      return value.toInt();
    else if (value.looksULongLong())
      return value.toULongLong();
    else if (value.looksDouble())
      return value.toDouble();
    return value;
  }
  function main()
  {
    var hosts = cluster::hosts();
    var value = getSqlVariable(hosts[0], "COM_SELECT");
    print("*** value: ", value);
    return value.isInt();
  }

Here is an example that shows how to execute an SQL query on the Cmon Database:

.. code-block:: c++

  var retval = CmonDb::executeSqlQuery("select * from mysql_states;");
  var passed = true;
  if (!retval["success"])
  {
    error("Executing SQL query failed: ", retval["errorMessage"]);
  }
  
  for (idx = 0; idx < retval["result"].rows(); ++idx)
  {
    var string = retval["result"][idx, 2];
    print(retval["result"][idx, 2]);
    if (string.empty())
    {
      error("Value at idx = ", idx, " is empty.");
    }
  }

Executing shell commands
````````````````````````

.. code-block:: javascript

  function listFiles(host)
  {
    var retval = host.system("ls -lha /home");
    if (!retval["success"])
      error("ERROR: ", retval["errorMessage"]);
    print("Host    : ", host.hostName());
    print("Result  : ", retval["result"]);
    print("Success : ", retval["success"]);
    return retval["success"];
  }

Obtaining and processing statistical information
````````````````````````````````````````````````

The following example shows how to obtain statistical data from a specific host about a specific time interval and how to process the data using low-level indexing operators. For the most task there are more efficient high-level statistical functions that can be used without looping through the data, but low-level access can be also beneficial for custom calculations.

.. code-block:: c++

  //
  // Going through the memory statistics of the last 10 minutes and printing the
  // size of the free memory with the time.
  //
  #include "cmon/io.h"
  function toGigaBytes(value)
  {
    return value / (1024 * 1024 * 1024);
  }
  function main()
  {
    var host      = cluster::hosts()[0];
    var endTime   = CmonDateTime::currentDateTime();
    var startTime = endTime - 10 * 60;
    var stats     = host.memoryStats(startTime, endTime);
    var retval    = true;
    for (idx = 0; idx < stats.size(); ++idx)
    {
      map     = stats[idx];
      created = CmonDateTime::fromUnixTime(map["created"]);
      ramfree = toGigaBytes(map["ramfree"]);
      print(
        created.toString(LongTimeFormat), 
        " ", ramfree.toString(TwoDecimalNumber), "GBytes");
    }
    return retval;
  }

The next example shows a sophisticated recipe to process some of the statistical data using high level statistical functions. It first get the data calling the ``host.memoryStats()`` function, then it filters all the memory utilization information into an array. This array then can be processed by statistical functions like ``min()``, ``max()`` or ``percentile()``.

.. code-block:: c++

  //
  // Printing the min, the ninth percentile and the max of the memory utilization
  // in the last ten minutes for every host. Prints something like this:
  //
  //        MEMORY UTILIZATION 
  // HOST       MIN     NINTH     MAX
  // 127.0.0.1 42.00% - 42.58% - 42.64%
  //
  #include "cmon/io.h"
  function printUtil(host, startTime, endTime)
  {
    var list  = host.memoryStats(startTime, endTime);
    var array = list.toArray("memoryutilization");
    var min   = min(array);
    var max   = max(array);
    var ninth = percentile(array, 0.9);
    print(host.hostName(),
          " ", 
          min.toString(TwoDecimalPercent), " - ",
          ninth.toString(TwoDecimalPercent), " - ",
          max.toString(TwoDecimalPercent));
    
    return true;
  }
  function main()
  {
    var endTime   = CmonDateTime::currentDateTime();
    var startTime = endTime - 10 * 60;
    var hosts     = cluster::hosts();
  
    print("       MEMORY UTILIZATION ");
    print("HOST       MIN     NINTH     MAX");
    for (idx = 0; idx < hosts.size(); ++idx)
      printUtil(hosts[idx], startTime, endTime);
    return true;
  }

Alarms
````````````````````````

.. code-block:: c++

  #include "cmon/alarms.h"
  var hosts   = cluster::hosts();
  var host    = hosts[0];
  var alarms;
  var found   = false;
  //
  // Raising an alarm
  //
  host.raiseAlarm(MySqlAdvisor, Critical, "Some message.");
  //
  // Reading the active alarms and searching for the same alarm.
  //
  alarms = host.alarms();
  for (idx = 0; idx < alarms.size(); ++idx)
  {
    if (alarms[idx]["title"] == "MySQL advisor alarm")
    {
      found = true;
      break;
    }
  }

The following example demonstrates how to create a custom alarm type and raise an alarm with the custom alarm.

.. code-block:: c++

  //
  // Demonstrating custom alarms.
  //
  #include "cmon/alarms.h"
  //
  // This function returns an alarm type for a custom alarm with some 
  // properties encoded into the function.
  //
  function myAlarm()
  {
    return Alarm::alarmId(
          Node, true, 
          "Computer is on fire", 
          "The computer is on fire, it is on flames.", 
          "Pour some water on it.");
  }
  var myAlarmId = myAlarm();
  var hosts     = cluster::hosts();
  var host      = hosts[0];
  var sentMessage;
  sentMessage = host.raiseAlarm(myAlarmId, Critical);
  //
  // An alarm is raised and sentMessage should be:
  // Server 127.0.0.1 reports: The computer is on fire, it is on flames.
  //

Configuration files
````````````````````````

.. code-block:: c++
  
  function getConfiguredClientPort(host)
  {
    var config      = host.config();
    var variable    = config.variable("port");
    for (idx = 0; idx < variable.size(); ++idx)
    {
      print("*** section  : ", variable[idx]["section"]);
      print("*** value    : ", variable[idx]["value"]);
      print("*** location : ", 
            variable[idx]["filepath"], ":", variable[idx]["linenumber"]);
      if (variable[idx]["section"] == "client")
          return variable[idx]["value"].toInt();
    }
    return #N/A;
  }

Creating graphs
````````````````````````

The following example shows how to create a graph, set up with statistical data and return to the UI to be shown as an image.

.. code-block:: c++

  //
  // This is a test program that prints a graph on the sql statistics.
  //
  #include "cmon/graph.h"
  var hosts     = cluster::hosts();
  var host      = hosts[0];
  var endTime   = CmonDateTime::currentDateTime();
  var startTime = endTime - 10 * 60;
  var stats     = host.sqlStats(startTime, endTime);
  var array     = stats.toArray(
    "created,interval,COM_SELECT,COM_INSERT");
  //
  // Calculating some values from the statistics
  //
  for (idx = 0; idx < array.columns(); idx++)
  {
    array[5, idx] = 1000 * array[2, idx] / array[1, idx];
    array[6, idx] = 1000 * array[3, idx] / array[1, idx];
  }
  var graph     = new CmonGraph;
  graph.setXDataIsTime();
  graph.setTitle("SQL Statistics " + host.toString());
  graph.setSize(800, 600);
  // This graph contains two plots, we set the various properties for them here 
  // here. The plot index will be 1 and 2.
  graph.setPlotLegend(1, "Select (1/s)");
  graph.setPlotColumn(1, 0, 5);
  graph.setPlotStyle(1, Impulses);
  graph.setPlotLegend(2, "Insert (1/s)");
  graph.setPlotColumn(2, 0, 6);
  graph.setPlotStyle(2, Impulses);
  graph.setData(array);
  exit(graph);

The following example shows how to interact with Mongo:

.. code-block:: javascript

  // Mongo JS example
  function main()
  {
      var hosts   = cluster::mongoNodes();
      for (i = 0; i < hosts.size(); i++)
      {
          host        = hosts[i];
          print(host.hostName());
          var config      = host.config();
          var variable    = config.variable("port");
          for (idx = 0; idx < variable.size(); ++idx)
          {
              print("*** section  : ", variable[idx]["section"]);
              print("*** value    : ", variable[idx]["value"]);
              print("*** location : ", 
                      variable[idx]["filepath"], ":", variable[idx]["linenumber"]);
              if (variable[idx]["section"] == "client")
                  return variable[idx]["value"].toInt();
          }
        
        
          var res= host.executeMongoQuery("{ serverStatus : 1 }");
          print(res["result"]["host"]);
          print(res["result"]["storageEngine"]["name"]);
        
          var endTime = CmonDateTime::currentDateTime();
          var startTime = endTime - 10 * 60;
          var stats     = host.mongoStats(startTime, endTime);
          var array     = stats.toArray("created,interval,opcounters.command");
          for (idx = 0; idx < array.columns(); idx++)
          {
              var x= 1000 * array[2, idx] / array[1, idx];
              //print(x);
          }
          break;
      }
  }

To-do
+++++

* The ``typeof x`` is not implemented, although we have the ``x.typeName()`` for the same purpose.
* The ``with`` is not implemented.
* Passing function object arguments as references is not implemented.
* Implement a CmonTimer based solution to measure milliseconds.
* Functions inside functions are not implemented.
* bash host {...}
